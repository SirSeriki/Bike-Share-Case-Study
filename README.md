2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Deliverables

* A clear statement of the business task
* A description of all data sources used
* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
* A summary of the analysis
* Supporting visualizations and key findings

# Key Takeways

 Dates don't have any impact on the riding pattern
It seems more member riders ride on Tuesday and Wednesdays. While causal riders ride more on weekends.
The months of July, August and September record the highest number of rides, with August seeing the higest rides.
Member riders contribute more to the overall monthly rides for at least half the year
Member riders constitute 81% of the weekday rides, while casual riders constitute a total of 43% of the weekend rides, a significant increase in casual riders during the weekend compared to weekday
The top preferred station for casual and member riders is Canal st & Adams St
Casual riders have a longer ride time than member riders on the average even though the proportion of member riders is higher. 
 
 Recommendations

As per analysis July, August and September record the highest number of rides, with August seeing the highest rides. We will recommend that stakeholders run campaigns starting from July until September. Starting with a giveaway promotion at Canal st 7 Adams st station on a Friday, as this is most preffered station by casual riders and one of the days with the highest number of Casual riders.

Also, based on our analysis Casual riders constitute the longest duration of rides, digital billboards should be installed along riding routes between stations showing the benefits available to member riders.
